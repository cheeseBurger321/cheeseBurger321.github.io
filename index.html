  <h1> There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
Then school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it
<br>
Like maybe...
Building a rocket
Or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
<br>
Discovering something that doesn't exist
Phineas: Hey!
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves
Creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Phineas: It's over here!
<br>
Finding a dodo bird
Painting a continent
Or driving our sister insane
Candace: Phineas!
<br>
As you can see
There's a whole lot of stuff to do
Before school starts this fall
Phineas: Come on Perry!
So stick with us
'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!
So stick with us
         'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all! </h1>
